About Dash (from the website):

> Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 200+ APIs, 100+ cheat sheets and more. You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.

It's only available for Mac but there are ports for Windows and Linux as well (haven't tested, see below)
